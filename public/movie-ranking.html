<h1>The Best Movies According to Yusuf</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Matrix Trilogy</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie-serie. I love the philosophy and the graphics of this trilogy. (I live in a world that Matrix 4 has not released :) )</p>
<h3>The Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p>This is another trilogy. I love it, J.R.R. Tolkien created an amazing universe here. </p>
<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film. Really cool.</p>
